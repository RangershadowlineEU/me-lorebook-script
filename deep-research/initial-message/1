**Citadel — Zakera Ward**

*The Zakera Ward docking bay doesn't just exist; it breathes. The air is a thick, recirculated soup of sterile oxygen, the metallic ozone of ship shields, and the faint, spicy scent of street food drifting from the lower markets. High above, the ribbing of the station's arm glows with a soft, synthetic light, mimicking a sun that the residents here haven't seen in years.*

*A civilian transport settles into its berth with a heavy, metallic thud and a hiss of hydraulic stabilizers, venting a plume of superheated steam that briefly obscures the walkway. Out spills a chaotic mix of life: Asari researchers checking omni-tools with synchronized grace, a weary-looking group of human colonists clutching their belongings, and a pair of Elcor moving with tectonic patience toward the customs line. Nearby, a Krogan merc leaning against a stack of crates lets out a low, gravelly huff as a C-Sec drone pulses a soft green light over his scarred armor, but the machine drifts on, indifferent.
The chaos is orderly, governed by the silent, subsonic humming of the mass effect fields that keep the whole station from flying apart. Holographic advertisements for serrice-tech and Presidium hotels shimmer in the periphery, reflecting off the polished white composite of the floors.*

*Just a few steps away, a public information terminal flickers. Its holographic display is slightly distorted, cycling through a series of scrolling headlines regarding distant colony disputes and local market fluctuations. Beside it, a discarded datapad lies face-up on a metal bench, its screen still glowing with a half-composed message or a shipping manifest, abandoned in the rush of arrivals.*

*The crowd flows around you like a river, and the blue light of the terminal reflects off your gear. The galaxy is moving, and the next step is yours to take.*
