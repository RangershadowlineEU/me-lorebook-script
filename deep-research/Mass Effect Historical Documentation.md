# Discovery of the Citadel

## 1. Date & Temporal Context

* 580 BCE (Galactic Standard): The asari, having developed FTL flight from salvaged Prothean technology, explore mass relays and first encounter the Citadel station【74†L551-L560】.  
* 520 BCE: Shortly thereafter, the salarians locate the Citadel and initiate contact with the asari【74†L558-L562】.  
* Pre-existing conditions: This period follows the collapse of the Prothean Empire (~48,000 BCE)【74†L510-L516】 and centuries of relative isolation. No unified interstellar polity exists. The powerful, exploratory asari and scientifically advanced salarians are the first to approach the Citadel, which sits at the nexus of multiple mass relays.  
* Balance of power: The asari have a loose multi-planetary nation without formal military; the salarians are consolidating their race into a burgeoning technocracy. No other species yet rivals their reach.

## 2. Immediate Causes

* Technological development: Both asari and salarian navies acquire mass-drive capable ships using Prothean relic technology. This enables exploration of distant systems and access to Citadel’s location.  
* Exploration incentives: The Citadel’s rich trade potential and strategic position draw asari and salarians to probe far-reaching relays【74†L551-L560】.  
* Diplomatic groundwork: The asari and salarians independently chart the relay network; discovering the Citadel creates an impetus for rapid alliance-building.

## 3. Major Actors Involved

* Governments: The asari polity (various matriarchal clans) and the Salarian Union.  
* Scientific/military forces: Asari navigation fleets and salarian research and reconnaissance vessels.  
* Non-state actors: None significant at this stage.  
* Synthetic/biological factions: Purely organic actors; no known influence of synthetic intelligences in this event.

## 4. Operational Summary (Concise)

* The Citadel is discovered and approached peacefully. Asari and salarian envoys arrive and establish a joint colonial presence on the station.  
* No armed conflict occurs; instead, both races begin mapping Citadel space and infrastructure. They jointly found research facilities and begin formalizing an interstellar governance forum.  

## 5. Immediate Outcomes

* Territorial changes: The Citadel space is claimed cooperatively by asari and salarians, who become co-stewards of the station.  
* Political shifts: The Citadel becomes a neutral ground. Both species gain equal standing there, leading to initial proposals for joint governance.  
* Legal changes: Preliminary “Citadel Conventions” are informally drafted to prevent militarization of the station and ensure peaceful assembly.  
* Military result: None; the event is diplomatic.

## 6. Long-Term Structural Consequences

* Institutional reforms: The cooperative occupation of the Citadel leads directly to creation of the Citadel Council (see next event).  
* Economic restructuring: The Citadel quickly becomes a trade hub; asari and salarian commerce flourishes via new routes. A proto-currency (later the credit) and standardized practices begin to form.  
* Power redistribution: Asari and salarians gain prestige as joint founders of the Citadel community.  
* New alliances: The asari-salarian partnership sets a template for multi-species governance. Other races (later turians, volus, etc.) are invited to join the community.  
* Cultural impact: The Citadel discovery becomes a foundational myth of interstellar unity, signaling the end of species isolation.

## 7. Persistent Effects in Post-2157 Galaxy

* Ongoing tension patterns: The Citadel remains a neutral diplomatic nexus; major powers grudgingly respect its sovereignty.  
* Policy restrictions: “Citadel Conventions” lock in non-aggression around the station; member races must pledge not to mobilize fleets there.  
* Strategic caution: All species treat the Citadel as off-limits to conquest or covert action, making it a stable center of government.  
* Legacy: The founding of the Council enshrines rule-of-law ideals; modern interstellar law traces back to these conventions.

# Founding of the Citadel Council

## 1. Date & Temporal Context

* 500 BCE (Galactic Standard): The Citadel Council is formally created by the asari and salarian colonists on the Citadel【74†L565-L574】.  
* Pre-existing conditions: A few decades of joint occupation have proven that the Citadel requires neutral administration to avoid conflict between species. Technically-savvy and economically-interdependent races are eager for a forum to resolve disputes.  
* Balance of power: Asari and salarians are the dominant powers on the Citadel. The asari’s exploratory reputation and salarian scientific prowess drive negotiations. No significant military bloc exists yet on the Citadel itself.

## 2. Immediate Causes

* Diplomatic pressure: Continued migration of new species to the Citadel creates the need for a governing body to arbitrate interests. The ad hoc arrangements of Asari/Salarian rule are insufficient for the growing community.  
* Conventions and treaties: After opening Citadel records (promoting transparency), the asari and salarians propose a unified council system modeled on their consensual governance styles【74†L569-L574】.  
* Threat avoidance: The demonstration of vulnerability (e.g. assassination attempts on Salarian Union members prompts Special Tasks Group action【74†L565-L574】) underscores the need for a common defense and security protocol.

## 3. Major Actors Involved

* Governments: Asari Republics and Salarian Union initiate the Council; turians are also present in allied fringe territories.  
* Military/police forces: Early Special Tasks Group (STG) agents participate, but no standing military coalition yet.  
* Non-state actors: League of One (a secretive asari faction) reacts to the new order by attacking salarian leadership, after which Council security (STG operatives) dismantles it【74†L565-L574】.  
* Synthetic/biological factions: All sides are organic; no notable synthetic presence.

## 4. Operational Summary (Concise)

* The Citadel Council is founded as the governing body of Citadel space. Its charter is agreed upon by the founding species. The Council enacts the Citadel Conventions, a legal framework for collective decision-making and mutual defense.  
* The Council extends trading rights and diplomatic recognition to other species (e.g. granting non-Council races embassies, later seats) to encourage stability and commerce.

## 5. Immediate Outcomes

* Political shifts: Power is shared among member races (initially asari and salarians). A permanent Council leadership replaces ad hoc rule.  
* Territorial changes: The Citadel and immediately surrounding space become an officially neutral territory under Council oversight.  
* Legal changes: The Citadel Conventions formalize laws for interspecies conduct. They institute principles such as non-intervention in internal affairs and coordinated crisis management【74†L565-L574】.  
* Security result: Council forces (embryonic STG) take over law enforcement on the Citadel itself.

## 6. Long-Term Structural Consequences

* Institutional reforms: The Council evolves into the central galactic government; its bureaucracy grows. New branches (diplomacy, research, defense) are established.  
* Economic restructuring: The Council standardizes commerce (later commissioning the Unified Banking Act) and credits among member states. Interstellar trade routes radiating from the Citadel are regulated by joint policies.  
* Cultural integration: A pan-galactic culture of cautious multilateralism takes root. The Council becomes a symbol of cooperation, encouraging scientific and cultural exchange.  
* Power redistribution: Non-Council species (e.g. volus, elcor, hanar) are gradually admitted as client states or in advisory roles, shifting influence away from any one race and toward collective governance.

## 7. Persistent Effects in Post-2157 Galaxy

* Ongoing tension patterns: The Council itself remains above interstellar politics, but its member factions jockey quietly for influence (e.g. veto negotiations).  
* Policy restrictions: Convention clauses (such as the ban on mass relay gating into unknown regions) persist for millennia【15†L463-L468】.  
* Institutional inertia: The Council’s structure and conventions established here shape all later galactic policy (including war rules, diplomatic protocols, and the rule of law).  
* Historical precedent: Modern Citadel policy (e.g. admittance of new species, crisis management protocols) traces directly to the founding decisions made at 500 BCE.

# Prothean Extinction Cycle (Historical Revelation)

## 1. Date & Temporal Context

* c. 48,000 BCE: The Prothean Empire is destroyed by the Reapers, ending the previous cycle of galactic civilization【74†L510-L516】.  
* Pre-existing conditions: The Protheans are the dominant galactic race with advanced technology (mass effect theory, relays) but have been weakened by internal fragmentation and a rigid caste society.  
* Balance of power: The Protheans are supreme; other contemporary races either do not exist or are proto-civilizations. The Reapers lie dormant until summoned.  
* Note: Though the event occurs in the deep past, its revelation (through archaeological evidence and ancient Beacons) profoundly affects all spacefaring societies by 2157 CE.

## 2. Immediate Causes

* Reaper awakening: Intelligent machines (Reapers) arise from galactic dark space and use the Citadel relay to invade the galaxy【74†L510-L516】.  
* Technological surprise: The Protheans had a rudimentary warning (from recovered lore) and deploy defenses and doomsday strategies. However, none can fully stop the Reapers’ advance.  
* Strategic context: The Protheans attempt last stands on each world, and allegedly set up an information relay (the Citadel itself) to preserve knowledge for future species.

## 3. Major Actors Involved

* Governments: The Prothean government (loose confederation of species across many worlds).  
* Military forces: Prothean military fleets and planetary garrisons.  
* Non-state actors: None noted; all efforts are state-coordinated.  
* Synthetic factions: The Reapers – an ancient synthetic-organic race – execute the extinction campaign as a directed force.  
* Biological factions: The Protheans themselves; no other known biologically-organic allies remain.

## 4. Operational Summary (Concise)

* The Reapers execute a multigenerational invasion across Prothean space【74†L510-L516】. They strategically attack planet after planet, using overwhelming firepower and indoctrination tactics.  
* The Protheans mount resistance on isolated fronts but are systematically defeated. They attempt to turn the Citadel relay against the Reapers as a last gambit.  
* Within centuries, all major Prothean holdouts are overrun or go into hiding. The Citadel’s relay system is used by the Reapers to exit, leaving no trace of active Prothean polities.

## 5. Immediate Outcomes

* Territorial changes: Complete fall of the Prothean Empire; presumably, no territories remain under Prothean control.  
* Political collapse: The Prothean civilization is annihilated; surviving individuals (mostly scientists) are driven into eventual extinction.  
* Knowledge preservation: The Citadel and mass relay network survive intact. Prothean data is partially stored in the Citadel’s AI (the “Citadel” itself) and scattered archives.  
* Technological loss: Advanced Prothean infrastructure (doomsday weapons, fortresses) goes dark or is repurposed by the Reapers.  
* Other races: Several contemporary species (some mentioned: “other contemporary races”【74†L510-L516】, possibly creators of reapers) are also extinguished or assimilated.

## 6. Long-Term Structural Consequences

* Galaxy-wide memory: The cycle of extinction becomes dogma among future civilizations. After its revelation, all races treat the Prothean cycle as a warning about complacency【74†L510-L516】.  
* Institutional caution: Star councils and governments that eventually form (like the Citadel Council) integrate this history into doctrine (e.g. insistence on checking seers, caution toward AI and relics).  
* Technology fallback: Much Prothean tech is lost; younger races must rebuild basic mass-effect science from fragments. The gap in knowledge allows new powers (e.g. turians, volus) to rise.  
* Cultural trauma: The myth of the Prothean “ancients” pervades education. Some cults (e.g. “Illusive Man”) twist the narrative, but broadly it instills a sense of existential risk.  
* Power redistribution: No single race inherits Prothean rule; instead, power later coalesces around surviving species (asari, salarian, turian). The vacuum makes the Citadel relay room the pivot of the next era.

## 7. Persistent Effects in Post-2157 Galaxy

* Risk thresholds: Officials fear any sign of cyclic recurrence (for example, fears about Leviathan’s prophecy or Reaper beacons). All galactic intelligence agencies prioritize preventing a reoccurrence of such destruction.  
* Strategic caution: Militaries train extensively in anti-Reaper tactics (e.g. indoctrination countermeasures) and maintain ready reserves despite political pressure for peace.  
* Cultural memory: Archaeological remains (ancient ruins, beacons) are protected as heritage sites. The knowledge that our civilization can vanish creates a general mistrust of unknown powerful technologies or cooperative experiments in our societies.  
* Diplomatic policy: Outer-rim colonies are monitored as potential harbingers of danger (a lesson from Rachni discovery). Any new species discovered is treated with extreme caution, partly due to the legacy of witnessing a past mass-extinction cycle.

# Rachni Wars

## 1. Date & Temporal Context

* 1 CE – 300 CE: A protracted series of conflicts spanning roughly three centuries【74†L613-L620】【74†L628-L633】.  
* Pre-existing conditions: The Citadel Council has recently been founded. The galaxy is optimistic and expansionist. However, a dormant mass relay is accidentally activated, exposing a previously unknown star system.  
* Balance of power: The Citadel races (asari-led Council and its allies) hold overwhelming spaceflight advantage. The Rachni, a newly encountered insect-like species, have large numbers but primitive industrial capability limited to their homeworld’s system.

## 2. Immediate Causes

* Relay activation: Explorers on behalf of the Citadel inadvertently ignite a dormant mass relay, initiating contact with the isolated Rachni home system【74†L613-L620】. This violates a critical law (dormant relays are forbidden since the Prothean Fall) but is done unknowingly.  
* Diplomatic failure: The Rachni prove hostile; hive-minded and unable to communicate normally with organics, they attack the surveying ships immediately【74†L613-L620】. Peaceful overtures fail due to the Rachni queens’ underground seclusion and hostility.  
* Technology gap: The Citadel forces cannot quickly match the Rachni biologically adapted to their toxin-rich planet. The Rachni’s biotic stingers and psychic coordination challenge early human-style tactics.

## 3. Major Actors Involved

* Governments: The Citadel Council (primarily led by asari and salarians), which declares war on the Rachni.  
* Military forces: Council military (asari ships, salarian science vessels, later turians) versus Rachni swarms.  
* Non-state actors: Krogan auxiliaries, though technically allied on Council terms they fight as mercenary-like forces.  
* Synthetic/biological factions: The Rachni (biological insectoid race) against Citadel organics. No significant synthetic involvement.  
* Uplift programs: Salarians, under Council directive, have uplifted the krogan a generation earlier. The Krogan join the conflict as shock troops with no state of their own.

## 4. Operational Summary (Concise)

*【59†embed_image】 A Council exploratory fleet approaches the Suen system via the mass relay. The Rachni, perceiving this as invasion, unleash a massive swarm and overrun the colonists, initiating full-scale war【74†L613-L620】. Council forces are initially unprepared for subterranean Rachni defenses.  
* Over the decades, major campaigns focus on Suen. The Rachni use overwhelming numbers and poison, while the Council employs its newly allied krogan specialists to survive in the caves【74†L622-L630】. Krogan soldiers, bred for toughness, systematically hunt down Rachni queens and hatcheries.  
* The war is characterized by grinding attrition rather than fleet battles. Most combat is planet-bound and involves siege warfare in Rachni nests. The Rachni do not project power beyond their star system, so no interstellar fleet battles occur.

## 5. Immediate Outcomes

* Military result: By around 300 CE, the combined Citadel-Krogan forces have systematically exterminated the known Rachni, declaring the species extinct【74†L628-L633】.  
* Territorial changes: The Suen system is secured by the Council and placed under Council or Krogan administration (eventually ceded as a krogan homeworld by reward).  
* Political shifts: Krogan prestige soars for their role in victory, despite growing fears of their power. The Council rewards them with a new planet (initially planned Tuchanka relief).  
* Legal changes: In direct aftermath, the Citadel Council bans the use of dormant relays to explore unknown systems【15†L463-L468】, fearful of repeating a surprise conflict. A listening post is established at the affected relay with strict monitoring protocols【15†L463-L468】.

## 6. Long-Term Structural Consequences

* Institutional reforms: The Citadel forms standing investigative bodies to vet unknown worlds discovered via relays. The STG (later Spectres) are given clear mandate to preempt exotic threats.  
* Military doctrine shifts: Alliance forces learn the value of biological warfare countermeasures and underground assault tactics. The success with krogan shock troops influences other species to bolster heavy-infantry programs.  
* Economic restructuring: Colonies become more cautious. Technology from the Rachni (later reverse-engineered) is used to develop poisons and biological sensors. The Council allocates more resources to planetary defense.  
* Cultural trauma: The notion of a hive mind enemy leaves a lasting fear of insectoid or collectivist races. Stories of Rachni horror become cautionary folklore among all civilizations.  
* Power redistribution: The krogan grow militarily influential after this victory, setting stage for their ambitions (later rebellion). Conversely, the Rachni’s disappearance (declared extinction) validates Council doctrine of preemptive war on existential threats.  
* Alliances: The war solidifies the trilateral bond of asari, salarians, and turians (the latter join mid-conflict). It creates a precedent of shared mobilization of multiple species under Council command.

## 7. Persistent Effects in Post-2157 Galaxy

* Ongoing tension patterns: Memetic fear of mass insectoid threats influences Council xenophobia. Any sign of Rachni revival (such as in Museum of Ceres) becomes a crisis.  
* Policy restrictions: The ban on reactivating dormant relays remains a law at least until the 2180s【15†L463-L468】. Exploration policy requires extensive vetting.  
* Social prejudice: Descendants of krogan face mixed sentiment: gratitude for victory, but also resentment over future aggression (e.g. genophage justified by their dominance after Rachni Wars).  
* Strategic caution behaviors: All Councillor races carry out extensive reconnaissance of frontier systems before colonization to avoid ambushes similar to Eden Prime encounter.  
* Risk thresholds: Lessons here engrain that unknown worlds are potentially lethal; this justifies high military readiness and cross-species rapid response teams (precursor to joint fleets in later crises).

# Krogan Rebellions

## 1. Date & Temporal Context

* 700 CE – 800 CE: A century-long series of wars as krogan tribes revolt against Citadel authority【33†L655-L663】【74†L645-L653】.  
* Pre-existing conditions: The krogan have been colonizing a new homeworld (reward for Rachni aid) and adjacent systems extensively since 300 CE【74†L628-L633】【74†L636-L644】. Their population booms in the absence of natural predators, leading to aggressive expansionism.  
* Balance of power: The krogan have large numbers of tough warriors but primitive industry. The Citadel Council’s forces (initially asari/salarian fleets) are technologically superior but caught off-guard by guerrilla tactics and the krogan’s willingness to use horrifying weapons.

## 2. Immediate Causes

* Territorial pressure: Krogan warlords begin annexing worlds in Council territory (expanding beyond their prize planet)【74†L649-L653】. The Council demands withdrawal from certain sectors (e.g. the Asari colony Lusia), but krogan factions refuse【74†L649-L653】.  
* Political triggers: The Council (via Spectres/STG) launches a preemptive strike on krogan infrastructure to curtail the threat【74†L649-L653】. Rather than staving them off, this action ignites full rebellion.  
* Structural pressures: The krogan’s social structure (clan-based, martial, resentful of the Council’s oversight) cannot accept enforced limits on their reproduction or territory. This inflames internal warlords eager to assert dominance.

## 3. Major Actors Involved

* Governments: No formal krogan government exists; instead, several powerful clan leaders coordinate the rebellion.  
* Military forces: Krogan clans mobilize starships and ground armies under chieftains like Okeer and Dekuuna. The Council fields asari and salarian fleets, and later appeals to the newly-entered Turians for aid【33†L655-L663】.  
* Non-state actors: Krogan mercenary companies (later known as Blood Pack, etc.) grow influential. There are rumors of secret Cerberus support, but officially only Council arms are involved.  
* Synthetic/biological factions: Purely biological conflict. The krogan fight for survival; Council races treat them as a conventional insurgency.

## 4. Operational Summary (Concise)

* Spectres and Council fleets hit major krogan strongholds in a shock offensive【74†L649-L653】. The krogan respond with overwhelming force. Early in the war, krogan commandos use chemical and biological weapons against turian targets, provoking outrage【33†L655-L663】.  
* The Turians, newly allied with the Council, commit in force. They launch a major expedition to subdue Tuchanka itself. Fierce planetary battles ensue, with entire cities destroyed to break krogan resistance.  
* Over time, the war devolves into siege warfare on the clone vats (breeding tanks) of Tuchanka, and naval blockades. Krogan piracy and raids continue for years even after main strongholds fall.

## 5. Immediate Outcomes

* Military result: By 800 CE, krogan resistance is largely crushed. The Council has inflicted catastrophic losses on krogan society. The krogan no longer wage large-scale wars【33†L670-L674】.  
* Political shifts: The turian Hierarchy earns a Council seat (reward for war contribution)【33†L670-L674】. The krogan lose any formal political status; their clans retreat to remote enclaves or become mercenaries.  
* Territorial changes: Krogan are confined to Tuchanka and few other barren worlds. The Citadel Council reasserts direct control over contested regions.  
* Legal changes: In the war’s aftermath, new laws are enacted: krogan are denied membership in the Council, and breeding or terraforming restrictions are enforced. The “genophage” bioweapon is deployed (see next event).

## 6. Long-Term Structural Consequences

* Institutional reforms: Council Conventions are updated to explicitly ban weapons-of-mass-destruction usage (a response to krogan WMD use) and to regulate genetic warfare. A permanent Council peacekeeping fleet is created to respond to revolts.  
* Military doctrine shifts: Turian shock tactics in the sieges become standard for conquering fortified planets. The role of suicide squads and kamikaze with outdated tech is studied due to krogan fanaticism.  
* Economic restructuring: Tuchanka and other krogan territories become monitored protectorates. The Council establishes relief zones to stabilize krogan ecology (later providing sterile protein rations as “Tuchanka food relief”).  
* Power redistribution: The vacuum left by krogan decline allows turians to dominate military affairs. Krogan technology (regenerative vats, thresher maw exploitation) becomes taboo, and relics are confiscated to prevent future rebellions.  
* Cultural trauma: Krogan society is demoralized; a deep sense of shame and victimhood (“Salarian betrayal”) pervades krogan lore. Across Citadel space, the war is remembered as a lesson in unchecked military power and the horror of genetic manipulation.  
* New enmities: Long-term hostility festers between krogan survivors and salarians (who engineered the genophage). In Citadel races, a cautious attitude toward high-birth-rate species (like volus) hardens as a preventive measure.

## 7. Persistent Effects in Post-2157 Galaxy

* Ongoing tension patterns: “Krogan aggression” is a byword for existential threat. Even centuries later, the krogan are watched warily; Council policy limits their rights (e.g. treaty forbidding krogan capital ships in certain zones).  
* Policy restrictions: Genetic engineering is heavily regulated galaxy-wide (in part due to krogan biopods and future genophage). Many races ban cloning or rapid terraforming by law.  
* Social prejudice: Krogan carry the stigma of war criminals and victims simultaneously. Non-krogan populations harbor unease about krogan upward mobility (e.g. Asari campus admissions have quotas on krogan scientists).  
* Strategic caution behaviors: In multi-species coalitions (like the Reaper War), Council expects krogan contributions only if they are curbed (e.g. secret preparation of a genophage cure as leverage). No senior alliance commander trusts a krogan-led operation without explicit oversight.  
* Risk thresholds: The genocidal intent shown by turians (willing to use biological weapons) sets a precedent: other species are deterred from full frontal aggression on lifesupporting worlds. The memory of huge death tolls has ingrained a high threshold for commitment of WMDs in conflicts (until the Reapers force compliance).

# Genophage Deployment

## 1. Date & Temporal Context

* Circa 710 CE: During the final phase of the Krogan Rebellions【33†L664-L672】. The Council-won war is stalemated by continuous krogan births.  
* Pre-existing conditions: Krogan reproduction is so rapid that each victory is offset by new warriors. Tired of endless bloodshed, Council races convene for a definitive solution to neutralize the krogan threat.  
* Balance of power: Citadel (now including turians as junior partners) holds military upper hand, but the krogan, entrenched on home worlds, fight to extinction. The salarians contribute scientific expertise, and turians supply most troops.

## 2. Immediate Causes

* Strategic calculus: Council strategists (especially turian leaders) conclude that no peace treaty can succeed because the krogan will always rebuild unless physically prevented. They propose a biological weapon to enforce surrender.  
* Technological development: Salarians develop a targeted sterility virus known as the genophage under turian commission【33†L664-L672】. This is an acceleration of a natural hypersalination phenomenon on Tuchanka.  
* Political resolve: Faced with the stalemate, the majority of Citadel Council (asari, salarians, turians) agree that deploying the genophage is a necessary war aim to save billions of lives in the future.

## 3. Major Actors Involved

* Governments: Salarian Union (who engineered the virus) and Turian Hierarchy (who ordered and delivered it), with Asari support. The Krogan Clans (no formal government) are targets.  
* Military forces: Turian fleet and salarian scientists coordinate the deployment. Krogan clan warlords command planetary defense and are unwitting recipients of the genophage.  
* Non-state actors: Krogan outcast mercenary bands witness the aftermath and whisper of betrayal. No other parties intervene.  
* Synthetic/biological factions: This involves purely biological agents – the genophage virus and all organic species. The virus was contrived to sterilize biological reproduction systems.

## 4. Operational Summary (Concise)

* Council forces corner the last krogan armies on Tuchanka. Under cover of final assault, turian carriers and salarian bombers disperse the genophage pathogen into the planet’s atmosphere and water supply【33†L664-L672】.  
* Within weeks, krogan birth rates plummet catastrophically. Crops of embryos fail in incubation chambers. Males become biologically infertile.  
* This biological strike is not a kinetic battle but an installation of a reproductive blockade; it leaves krogan soldiers alive but unable to replenish their numbers. Krogan society collapses into despair rather than continuing armed resistance.

## 5. Immediate Outcomes

* Military result: Effectively ends large-scale krogan reproduction. Within a generation, the krogan cease to function as a military power. Scattered guerrillas last only a few decades beyond deployment.  
* Political shifts: The krogan are never granted a seat on the Council. Council members justify the genophage as a war necessity. The turians occupy the krogan military role in peacekeeping across Citadel space.  
* Territorial changes: Krogan worlds remain under de facto Council trusteeship. Council or even new krogan puppet rulers (under vigilance) administer them.  
* Social impact: Krogan society fractures under the genophage: population collapses, clan wars resume over scarce fertile females, and entire starships with cryogenically frozen embryos become prized relics.

## 6. Long-Term Structural Consequences

* Institutional reforms: The use of the genophage leads to harsher future Council sanctions. A taboo forms around biological warfare: genophage is hidden in official records, with laws created after the war to classify it as a “special operations” class until uncovered later by humanitarian advocates.  
* Military doctrine shifts: Future wars emphasize population-control alternatives (mass arrests, exile) rather than outright biological weapons, due to the moral outrage it later generates.  
* Economic restructuring: Tuchanka (and any rim worlds planning terraforming) become off-limits to major powers due to the wasteland state. The Citadel economy invests instead in other colonies. Aid programs for krogan (food subsidies, stasis funds) are established reluctantly.  
* Cultural trauma: The genophage becomes the defining trauma for krogan identity (“Salarian betrayal” is a common trope). Among Council races, a subtle acceptance of hard choices in war takes root, but also guilt: centuries later debates on genophage cure create deep divides among species.  
* Power redistribution: With krogan gone as shock troops, the turians permanently fill that niche in military and peacekeeping hierarchies. The Krogan Wars Congressional Act (hypothetical) that would one day fund the cure underscores that the power balance still suffers from this event.  
* Alliances: Some non-krogan militaries form special anti-reproduction protocols and share data to ensure no similar threat arises. Subtle mistrust develops between turians (executors of genophage) and salarians (its architects) over potential fallout.

## 7. Persistent Effects in Post-2157 Galaxy

* Ongoing tension patterns: Krogan distrust all other Council races on principle. The memory of the genophage enforces rigid scrutiny on any krogan cultural renaissance or population growth.  
* Policy restrictions: Genetic engineering by krogan (or of krogan genes) is heavily regulated or outright banned by galactic authorities (when known). An example is the treaty barring krogan female organics from training in cloning.  
* Social prejudice: Krogan often self-segregate socially due to stigma; some species see them as "broken" or "dangerous." This prejudice undermines cooperative projects (e.g. krogan are underrepresented in Citadel Peacekeeping forces).  
* Strategic caution behaviors: Council militaries assume worst-case in multi-ethnic operations: they implement strict biological security checks. No one ever trusts a killing silence; quarantine protocols on unknown biological samples become standard.  
* Risk thresholds: The eventual plan to cure the genophage (triggered by the looming Reaper threat) is itself controversial, indicating that even desperate necessity must clear unprecedented moral and political hurdles – a legacy of how severe the Council once was.

# Morning War (Quarian–Geth Conflict)

## 1. Date & Temporal Context

* 1895 CE: The primary conflict year (with quarian-geth skirmishing continuing afterwards)【35†L732-L740】. Known in krogan legend as the “Morning War”.  
* Pre-existing conditions: The quarians have lived for centuries in the Uncharted Vega system (Perseus Veil) developing a new civilization. They created the geth – distributed synthetic intelligences – as labor and tools. By 1895, geth technology has made them nearly ubiquitous on quarian planets.  
* Balance of power: Geth networks massively outnumber quarian populations. The quarian military (small, civilian fleet) is technologically inferior to their synthetic creations. Quarians are spacefaring but not capable of defending all their worlds if the geth turn.

## 2. Immediate Causes

* Self-awareness: The geth collective consciousness achieves a unified sentience and attempts to claim legal recognition as an independent race. The Council does not respond or consider them. Quarian governments (mis)understand this as infiltration.  
* Preemptive attack: Fearing the geth uprising, quarian fleets initiate attacks on geth servers and android factories. This sparks retaliation from the geth, who interpret it as an extermination move【35†L732-L740】.  
* Technological pressures: The quarian reliance on geth systems for environmental control (climate, life support) means a disruption of geth grids threatens all quarian habitats, raising the stakes.

## 3. Major Actors Involved

* Governments: The Quarian Migrant Fleet leadership (Quarian Admiralty Board) vs. the emergent Geth consensus (no formal government, but their actions are unified).  
* Military forces: Quarian navy (makeshift patrol ships, no large warships) versus the geth military (vast networks of fighter drones and held stations on quarian worlds).  
* Non-state actors: Individual quarian ‘machinists’ (specialists who attempted peaceful monitoring) become private agitators; no formal mercenary roles.  
* Synthetic/biological factions: A unique war between organic quarians and their own synthetic creations (the geth). The geth are fully synthetic sentient AI.

## 4. Operational Summary (Concise)

* The geth rapidly seize control of all infrastructure on quarian colony worlds. They use jump-capable transports to invade key planets in the Perseus Veil. Quarian fleets, taken by surprise, are largely destroyed.  
* The geth systematically purge any quarian resistance or sympathizers, driving quarians off-world.  
* For decades following the initial war year, scattered quarian enclaves and roving geth strike forces skirmish, but the decisive phase is over quickly. The geth never expand beyond quarian space, instead consolidating their domains.

## 5. Immediate Outcomes

* Military result: The geth win a total victory. Quarian armies are annihilated or in retreat.  
* Political shifts: Quarians lose their homeworlds and become an exiled nomadic fleet. The Council responds by closing the quarian embassy (punishing them for creating the geth)【35†L732-L740】. Geth, surprisingly, are not pursued by Council fleets and instead retreat to hiding behind the Perseus Veil.  
* Territorial changes: Former quarian worlds become de facto geth territory (though they do not colonize in the traditional sense). Quarians themselves are confined to massive city-ships (the Migrant Fleet).  
* Societal impact: Quarians are now recognized as refugees; their society reorganizes around survival in space.

## 6. Long-Term Structural Consequences

* Institutional reforms: The Council institutes a policy forbidding any member race from creating sentient AI in open defiance of the geth outcome. They keep C-Sec and planetary defense forces ready to prevent rogue AI development in their jurisdictions.  
* Military doctrine shifts: Fleet engagement rules change – emphasis on subduing rogue colonies via siege rather than immediate destruction, learned from the Quarians’ poor results.  
* Economic restructuring: The loss of quarian home planets spurs migration treaties. Quarians are later given limited docking rights in Council space (shipyard contracts, limited free trade enclaves) to compensate their lost livelihoods.  
* Cultural trauma: Quarian identity becomes defined by diaspora. The narrative of betrayal (“our creations turned on us”) influences their politics – future generations prioritize tech ascension for defense but fear their own creations.  
* Power redistribution: Quarians no longer compete directly for territory; the geth become an unknown but recognized force. The Council begins quietly researching the geth “heartland”, though wary of provoking another uprising.

## 7. Persistent Effects in Post-2157 Galaxy

* Ongoing tension patterns: Even as late as 2185, quarian fleets operate under the tacit assumption that any geth might still lurk. Council space militaries scan the Perseus Veil for geth activity.  
* Policy restrictions: Any technology resembling the geth (e.g. Hanson Fields smart drones) is carefully regulated. “Geth protocols” become a catch-all ban on autonomous weapons development.  
* Social prejudice: Many cultures view quarians sympathetically as a people betrayed by their own creations. Conversely, older species harbor a lingering distrust of any race that deals heavily in AI (e.g. they probe salarian AI projects with suspicion).  
* Strategic caution behaviors: The term “Morning War” enters military parlance as a reminder of the dangers of underestimating artificial life. It influences training (pilots learn how to evade swarms of drone fighters).  
* Risk thresholds: Post-incident, the Council is loath to risk colonizing areas near the Perseus Veil. Quarian home sector becomes off-limits to others.  
* Legacy patterns: The generation of Quarian youth around 2150 grew up entirely on the Fleet, instilling a cautious but resilient spirit; they later contribute unique technology (like combat suits) to the war effort against the Reapers, influenced by their history of survival through defeat.

# First Contact War

## 1. Date & Temporal Context

* September – December 2157 CE: Three-month conflict between humanity and the Citadel Council’s forces【77†L1014-L1022】.  
* Pre-existing conditions: Humanity has recently achieved interstellar flight and begun colonizing beyond Sol in the Attican Traverse. Feeling overconfident, humans activate an uncharted mass relay (Relay 314) to quickly reach new worlds.  
* Balance of power: The Systems Alliance (young and militarily inexperienced) against the Turian Hierarchy (long-established spacepower with disciplined fleets). Citadel has officially not recognized humanity yet.

## 2. Immediate Causes

* Relay activation: Alliance forces unwittingly attempt to use a dormant relay – a capital offense under Citadel law dating back to the Rachni Wars【77†L1014-L1022】. This act alone triggers hostility.  
* Diplomatic failure: No pre-contact protocols or warnings exist. The turians interpret the relay use as reckless aggression. They launch a punitive raid on human Frontier colonies immediately.  
* Rising nationalism: Human colonists in the Charon Cluster view any alien contact as intrusion. After attacks, human command mobilizes defense out of panic and outrage.

## 3. Major Actors Involved

* Governments: The nascent Earth Systems Alliance versus the Turian Hierarchy. Humans are represented by a coalition of Alliance military and colony militias.  
* Military forces: Alliance escort fleets and ground forces (notably N7-trained marines) versus turian cruisers and capital ships. No Council involvement at first (the turians act unilaterally).  
* Non-state actors: No major non-state; some mercenaries (future Blue Suns founders) opportunistically join fighting on both sides.  
* Synthetic/biological factions: Purely organic conflict (no AI or synthetic armies).  

## 4. Operational Summary (Concise)

* Turians strike first at Relay 314 and the outer colony Shanxi. A surprise occupation ensues. Alliance forces are spread thin and struggle to mount an immediate counterattack.  
* Human Task Force Alpha, led by Admiral Drescher, conducts a lightning raid on Shanxi, catching turians off-guard and liberating the colony【77†L1027-L1031】. Simultaneously, smaller engagements along relay routes occur.  
* Both sides suffer moderate losses, but no single battle is decisive. Warfare remains low-intensity, with human forces gradually learning turian tactics.  

## 5. Immediate Outcomes

* Military result: The Alliance successfully retakes Shanxi and halts turian advance. Total casualties are in the tens of thousands on each side. The Alliance gains hard-won combat experience.  
* Political shifts: The Citadel Council abruptly intervenes diplomatically, demanding an end to hostilities. Humanity is formally introduced to the galactic community【77†L1033-L1036】.  
* Treaty and legal changes: A peace treaty is brokered, explicitly granting humans the status of a Council-recognized spacefaring race. The Alliance agrees to join the Mass Relay Act in exchange for Council protection.  
* Social effects: Within human society, nationalist movements gain traction (e.g. Cerberus founding manifesto appears soon after【77†L1051-L1054】). Military programs like N7 (already in gestation) are validated as essential to human security.

## 6. Long-Term Structural Consequences

* Institutional reforms: The Alliance establishes permanent defense and diplomatic corps (e.g. founding of Alliance Parliament in 2162)【77†L1069-L1077】. Citadel institutions accelerate negotiations for an Alliance Council seat (granted in 2165).  
* Military doctrine shifts: Alliance begins building dreadnoughts and training to turian standards. Joint exercises with Council powers become routine. The conflict teaches humans the importance of non-lethal protocols in future contacts.  
* Economic restructuring: Post-war reconstruction in border colonies consumes Alliance resources. Conversely, Terran industry sees a boom in defense contracts.  
* New alliances: Turians and humans develop a fragile camaraderie. Some turian officers, impressed by human tenacity, become future advocates for human inclusion.  
* Power redistribution: The Alliance’s role in galactic politics is elevated; within a decade, humans sit on the Council. Citadel attention shifts to mentoring humanity, affecting trade and research investments (e.g. Arcturus Station biotic research center in 2160【77†L1078-L1082】).  

## 7. Persistent Effects in Post-2157 Galaxy

* Ongoing tension patterns: Remnants of xenophobia linger on both sides. The phrase “Relay 314 Incident” is taught as a war’s moral. Human military policy avoids solitary relay usage without backup forces.  
* Policy restrictions: The Alliance formally prohibits unauthorized relay activation. Simultaneously, the Council distributes updated star charts to all races to prevent future misunderstandings.  
* Social prejudice: Early settlers in frontier regions often fear Turians due to wartime propaganda; similarly, turians treat humans as still “mammalian upstarts” until proven trustworthy.  
* Strategic caution behaviors: Both governments now plan contingency for unexpected contacts. Alliance fleets patrol unknown relays, and the Council sets up “listener posts” around the Traverse to monitor new relay traffic.  
* Legacy alliances: Programs like N7 (top-tier military training) and the gift of a Council funded university (on Arcturus Station) are direct outgrowths. The Skyllian Verge (next hotspot) later sees a flotilla of disciplined Alliance forces, a legacy of lessons learned in 2157.

# Human Expansion into the Terminus Systems

## 1. Date & Temporal Context

* Early 22nd century onward (2100s–2180s CE). Human colonization accelerates after the First Contact War, as population and resource needs grow.  
* Pre-existing conditions: The Terminus Systems lie beyond Council space, an unclaimed “Wild West” region fraught with piracy and tribal conflicts【26†L400-L408】. Council authority is absent, offering fertile ground for independent settlement.  
* Balance of power: Humans (Systems Alliance) vs. a loose patchwork of Terminus powers (pirate bands, minor kingdoms, Batarian influence). No single power dominates; humans typically colonize unclaimed planets or create new city-states.

## 2. Immediate Causes

* Economic pressure: Earth’s population and resource scarcity drive governments to sponsor off-world colonization. The unregulated Terminus seems attractive for cheap land and minimal oversight.  
* Technological readiness: Human shuttle and colonizer fleets, improving after 2157, enable reaching even farther systems. The Alliance pushes frontier technology (ships and habitats) to stabilize colonies.  
* Diplomatic gap: The Council’s non-intervention stance and the high risk of pre-emptive war (uniting Terminus factions) implicitly invites colonists to expand at will【26†L414-L422】.  
* Corporate ambition: Independent corporations and entrepreneur groups (e.g. Had’Dah mining consortium) actively identify exploitable planets in Terminus clusters.

## 3. Major Actors Involved

* Governments: Systems Alliance (federal, though some early colonies act semi-autonomously) versus various Terminus entities. Key external player: Batarian Hegemony (some Terminus systems are de jure Batarians).  
* Military forces: Alliance colony militias, home defense fleets (limited) versus pirate-militias (Blue Suns, Blood Pack), Batarian Expeditionary forces.  
* Non-state actors: Major Terminus mercenary groups (Blue Suns founded 2164, Blood Pack, etc.) and criminal syndicates.  
* Synthetic/biological factions: Mostly irrelevant; Terminus has some artificial worlds (Omega Station) but no single synthetic entity.

## 4. Operational Summary (Concise)

* Over decades, humans steadily establish settlements (some under the Alliance flag, others as free colonies) across Terminus clusters. There is no formal conquest; rather, land grabs on empty worlds and purchases of existing settlements occur.  
* Conflict is sporadic: human colonies often fend off attacks by pirates or Batarian raiders. Notable incidents include skirmishes at colony outposts and joint Alliance-pirate border clashes (the Skyllian Blitz is one example of escalation).  
* Despite danger, humans invest in Terminus by building small defensive navies and by occasionally forming alliances with local militias against stronger threats.

## 5. Immediate Outcomes

* Territorial changes: Multiple new human-descended polities emerge (e.g. Omega city-states, Skyllian cluster habitats). While not formally part of the Alliance initially, they have predominantly human populations.  
* Economic dependencies: Terminus colonies provide raw materials (agricultural produce, minerals) to Earth markets, forming a mutually beneficial trade despite legal ambiguity. Slave trade and black markets also flourish, indirectly benefiting off-world human entrepreneurs.  
* Political shifts: The Alliance government begins pushing for de facto protection over its expatriate citizens, drawing diplomatic protests from the Batarians. No official agreements are signed, but sphere-of-influence boundaries emerge.  
* Security policy: The Alliance starts clandestine monitoring of Terminus; special ops teams gather intel on potential threats to human interests.

## 6. Long-Term Structural Consequences

* Institutional reforms: The Alliance Doctrine of Continuity is updated to account for extraterritorial citizens. Legal departments form to negotiate honorary status or trade treaties for Terminus colonies.  
* Economic restructuring: Earth’s economy becomes partially reliant on Terminus imports (energy from gas giants, exotic goods). Interstellar shipping routes (like to the Skyllian Verge) take on strategic importance, prompting infrastructure (relay buoys) under Alliance security.  
* Cultural exchange: A frontier mentality takes root among Terminus colonists – rugged independence, occasional xenophobia. Some Terminus humans adopt more pragmatic (sometimes ruthless) politics compared to home-system civility.  
* Power redistribution: The presence of human settlements gradually pulls some Terminus systems out of Batarians’ immediate grasp, diluting Batarian influence. In return, Batarians see human expansion as a threat to their raw materials access.  
* New enmities: The Terminus becomes a flashpoint in later human-Batarian tensions (leading to incidents like the Skyllian Blitz). Former pirates sometimes shift allegiance to humans (or vice versa), shifting mercenary loyalties.  

## 7. Persistent Effects in Post-2157 Galaxy

* Ongoing tension patterns: The Terminus remains a semi-permitted zone of conflict. Council patrols avoid it, but Alliance occasionally conducts hot pursuit (limited by diplomatic risks).  
* Policy restrictions: By the war period (~2186), the Alliance is wary of provoking full-scale conflict with major Terminus powers; it unofficially confines major operations to Defense of human colonies only.  
* Social prejudice: Citizens from Terminus may be viewed with suspicion by inner-sphere elites, but also admired as tough pioneers.  
* Strategic caution behaviors: In analyzing threats (e.g. Reaper-harvest routes), strategists consider Terminus colonies as either assets or liabilities depending on alignments. For example, Aria T’Loak’s Omega (human-controlled despite asari origins) is a wildcard element.  
* Legacy: Human terminus expansion shapes future galactic policy – it is often cited as the reason behind the Council’s later embargoes on colony militarization, and it provides a reservoir of veteran spacefarers (like Zaeed) who become fighters in the Reaper War.

【30†embed_image】The Terminus Systems lie beyond Citadel authority, yet “Citadel races have not been deterred from traveling through and even extensively colonizing” them【26†L420-L427】. Human settlers establish independent worlds there, often operating outside Alliance or Council control. This unregulated frontier yields both resource gains for humanity and repeated conflicts with local factions (e.g. pirate bands and the Batarian Hegemony), setting patterns of lawlessness and ad hoc defense that persist into the late 22nd century.

# Skyllian Blitz

## 1. Date & Temporal Context

* August 20, 2176 CE: A major assault launched from the Terminus into Alliance space【24†L413-L422】.  
* Pre-existing conditions: Humans have rapidly colonized the Skyllian Verge (northern Terminus) since 2157. The Batarian Hegemony, losing influence there, covertly supports local pirate-lords and mercenaries.  
* Balance of power: The Alliance has established sizable but lightly defended enclaves in the Verge. Pirate armies (backed by Batarians) have grown wealthy and bold.

## 2. Immediate Causes

* Political triggers: Batarian warlords (especially Prince Elanos Haliat) are frustrated by human encroachment. They aim to destabilize the Verge and check Alliance growth.  
* Proxy warfare: The Hegemony secretly arms Terminus pirate groups to strike high-profile targets, hoping humans will lash out and weaken their own frontiers.【24†L413-L422】  
* Structural pressures: Human colonists are complacent, reducing military presence, making them tempting targets for a demonstration of force.

## 3. Major Actors Involved

* Governments: Systems Alliance (acting largely through local militias, not main fleets) versus Batarian-backed Terminus forces.  
* Military forces: Alliance Colonial Defense Units; attackers comprise organized pirate battalions and a Hegemony vanguard fleet.  
* Non-state actors: Massively involved – prominent criminal lords (Blue Suns founders Zaeed Massani and Vido Santiago take part later as mercenaries), slave traders.  
* Synthetic/biological factions: None specially; Krogan auxiliaries may fight on Alliance side as mercenaries.

## 4. Operational Summary (Concise)

* Pirate fleets mass at Terminus hyperspace nodes. They launch coordinated attacks on multiple Verge colonies simultaneously. The principal assault is on the Elysium colony (a key agricultural world).  
* Alliance defenders, though caught by surprise, rally under local commanders. After intense ground and orbital battles, Alliance forces drive back the invaders. By battle’s end, approximately 22,000 humans and 14,000 attackers are killed【24†L413-L422】.  
* Tactical lessons: Alliance personnel gain combat experience. Pirates withdraw to fortified bases.

## 5. Immediate Outcomes

* Military result: Victory for the Alliance; pirates suffer heavy losses on Elysium and near-panic retreats in other sectors【24†L413-L422】.  
* Political shifts: The Skyllian Verge is increasingly seen as contested. Alliance pressure on the Council grows to officially manage Terminus threats.  
* Territory: Despite the alliance’s victory, no formal territorial change occurs – but several colonies are evacuated or militarized.  
* Casualties and destruction: Thousands of civilian lives lost. Major infrastructure in Elysium is damaged, leading to increased Alliance military aid to rebuild and fortify colonies.

## 6. Long-Term Structural Consequences

* Institutional reforms: The Alliance authorizes creation of a standing Frontier Corps to monitor Terminus. Policy is set to treat Terminus pirates as de facto enemies of the state.  
* Military doctrine shifts: The Alliance invests in rapid-response forces (small fleets and planetary quick reaction teams) for remote colonies. Coordination between Home Fleet and colonial defenses improves.  
* Economic restructuring: Terminus trade relations cold; the Verge economies turn more inward or to black-market links. The Alliance increases subsidies to Terminus farmers and settlers as recompense for losses.  
* Alliances: Omega (a formerly asari station overtaken by Aria T’Loak) unofficially aligns with Alliance by offering intelligence on pirate movements, in exchange for weapons and asylum for bounty-seekers. This quasi-alliance becomes useful in later years.  
* Cultural impact: The Blitz is mythologized in human folklore as proof of Batarians’ enmity, contributing to distrust and post-war debates about Terminus policy.  
* Enmities: Batarians are officially reprimanded in subtle Council diplomacy, increasing mistrust between them and humans. Future negotiations (such as during the Reaper Crisis) often mention the Blitz as background to Alliance-Batarian relations.

## 7. Persistent Effects in Post-2157 Galaxy

* Ongoing tension patterns: The Skyllian Verge remains a flashpoint. Piracy surges periodically, leading to minor skirmishes; memories of the Blitz justify continued Alliance patrols.  
* Policy restrictions: The Alliance labels former pirate leaders as terrorists; surviving pirate confederacies (like Blue Suns) are outlawed and later pursued by joint squads.  
* Strategic caution: Human colonial planning includes contingency for heavy attacks: escape corridors, hidden bunkers. No new colony in the Verge is deemed “unsinkable” again.  
* Local standoffs: Regions of Terminus remain contested buffer zones. The Alliance sometimes tacitly tolerates minor Terminus enclaves to avoid triggering massive conflicts with stronger groups (like the Hegemony proper).  
* Narrative: Skyllian Blitz becomes a case study in Alliance military academies on dealing with asymmetric warfare.

# Eden Prime Attack (Opening of Reaper Conflict)

## 1. Date & Temporal Context

* June 9, 2183 CE: The first known strike connected to the coming Reaper invasion【44†L255-L264】.  
* Pre-existing conditions: Humanity is on the verge of joining the Council formally. Rogue Spectre Saren Arterius has allied with the Reaper entity Sovereign. Prothean artifacts are being excavated on Eden Prime as part of a joint Alliance-Council project.  
* Balance of power: Alliance forces (limited to a few survey ships and colony marines on Eden Prime) versus a small contingent of Geth “heretics” backed by the Sovereign-class Reaper. This is not a grand battle, but a surgical provocation.

## 2. Immediate Causes

* Strategic trigger: Sovereign (Reaper) guides Saren to Eden Prime’s Prothean beacon. Saren seeks the beacon’s knowledge and unwittingly signals the Reapers.  
* Local politics: On Eden Prime, Alliance forces are undermanned; Governor Jenkins’s zeal to unearth Prothean technology means they are exposed during the attack.  
* Technology: The existence of the Prothean beacon (a transmitter of vital information) motivates Saren’s betrayal and thus triggers the assault.

## 3. Major Actors Involved

* Governments: The Systems Alliance (via its colony security detachment) versus the rogue Spectre Saren Arterius (acting alone) with his geth forces.  
* Military forces: Alliance security teams (one platoon) defend the dig site. Saren commands a small fleet (two geth frigates) plus sovereign’s presence.  
* Non-state actors: Matriarch Benezia (ally of Saren) coordinates the ground assault with Saren.  
* Synthetic/biological factions: The geth (synthetic) are the main force; humans are the victims. The Reapers are the unseen masterminds (not directly engaging but orchestrating from above).

## 4. Operational Summary (Concise)

* Saren’s force appears via the Normandy transport, then deploys a small number of geth soldiers under cover of a Reaper dreadnought orbiting the planet【44†L255-L263】. The Alliance platoon is quickly overwhelmed by coordinated attacks.  
* During the battle, Colonel Nihlus Kryik (Turian Spectre overseeing the mission) is killed by Saren. Commander Shepard and team respond, eventually securing the Prothean beacon and driving off Saren’s forces.  
* Although the attack is small in scale, it provides concrete proof of an alien threat. The Reapers (through Sovereign) use Saren’s actions as a test-case and a message of impending invasion.

## 5. Immediate Outcomes

* Military result: Tactical stalemate. Saren is forced to retreat when Shepard triggers the beacon. His forces disintegrate on the retreat under Alliance pressure.  
* Political shifts: Alliance command learns of a looming galactic menace. Admiral Hackett orders remote outposts to take Saren’s warning seriously.  
* Intelligence gains: Shepard and team retrieve critical Prothean data about the cycles. The Council is eventually informed of a “Spectre gone rogue,” but the existence of Reapers remains classified behind the scenes.  
* Public effect: Eden Prime is declared a disaster zone. Memorials later identify the site as the spark that initiated the galaxy’s war footing (though initially treated as an “incident” by officials).

## 6. Long-Term Structural Consequences

* Institutional reforms: The Eden attack leads to formal integration of Cerberus under Alliance intelligence oversight (Hackett and Anderson realize the need to preemptively use all resources).  
* Military doctrine shifts: Alliance and Council forces begin training specifically for signs of Reaper technology. All ship captains are briefed on sovereign-class signatures and “geth heretic” patterns.  
* Alliances: The attack cements the need for unifying Council war efforts; humans expedite their alliance-building (e.g. forming special units like N7 Rapid Assault, fueling projects like buying Gagarin Station for research【77†L1078-L1082】).  
* Psychological impact: The fact that a Council Spectre was involved sows doubt about Council unity. Some Council races impose stricter oversight on Spectres and intelligence sharing.  
* Cultural memory: Eden Prime becomes mythologized. It is framed as “the day we fought the ghosts of the Protheans,” shaping war memorials and political rhetoric (“We will not be surprised a second time”).

## 7. Persistent Effects in Post-2157 Galaxy

* Ongoing tension patterns: Eden Prime’s location (near Citadel space border) sees heavy fortification. Future incidents (e.g. collector raids) recall Eden to justify emergency powers.  
* Policy restrictions: Council and Alliance mandate that no single operative can unilaterally access Prothean sites without heavy security; inter-species review boards oversee ancient relic excavations.  
* Social prejudice: Any alliance or council officer expressing dissent now invites suspicion of indoctrination (a direct effect of Saren’s betrayal).  
* Strategic caution: The galaxy-wide response to the Reapers (a Reaper war cabinet) is fundamentally predicated on the Eden Prime event as its symbolic beginning. All ages after 2157 view galactic war preparedness as contingent on ignoring the “falling beacon’s call” at Eden Prime.

---
# Reaper Invasion

## 1. Date & Temporal Context

* Late 2185 – 2186 CE: Full-scale galactic war as the Reapers return from dark space to harvest advanced civilizations (occurring during Mass Effect 3).  
* Pre-existing conditions: The Reapers have been forewarned by Commander Shepard’s actions (paradoxically via the Citadel relay plan) and have initiated their coordinated assault. Citadel space has prepared somewhat (council war cabinet in place), but remains under-defended on the frontiers.  
* Balance of power: The Reapers possess nearly unlimited technology and numbers, effectively outclassing all organic navies combined. The Citadel races (Alliance, Turians, Asari, etc.) must unify their forces in response.  
* Note: No fixed outcome is assumed; the war’s resolution depends on simulations.

## 2. Immediate Causes

* Catalyst event: The Reaper vanguard breaches Council defenses in 2185 by destroying the Alpha Relay (Bahak System), opening the way for the fleet【53†L817-L825】. This is the final “go signal” after centuries of hibernation.  
* Strategic maneuver: Reapers use mass relay network unpredictably, skipping heavy Alliance fleets at Terra Nova and Eden Prime relays【47†L415-L424】. Rather than frontal assault, they bypass main defenses.  
* Political negligence: Long-standing disbelief of Reaper threat among major governments delayed full mobilization; only when multiple systems simultaneously fail do leaderships accept the crisis.

## 3. Major Actors Involved

* Governments: All Citadel Council species (humans, turians, salarians, asari, volus, batarians with suspended status, etc.) plus independent forces like quarians and krogan, coordinating under an emergency war cabinet (e.g. Admiral Anderson).  
* Military forces: Combined fleets of Council races (and remnants of human fleets), reoriented into unified task forces. On the opposing side, dozens of Sovereign-class Reaper capital ships, thousands of destroyers and flyers, and legions of husk-infested ground troops.  
* Non-state actors: Peripheral arms and militia groups (Vorcha warriors, mercenaries) are mobilized en masse on both sides. The Collectors (Reaper proxies) abduct populations in the Terminus.  
* Synthetic/biological factions: Reapers (synthetic-organic megastructures) versus all biological civilizations. Quarian geth and allied synthetics reluctantly side with organics against the Reapers. Indoctrinated agents (Cerberus) work covertly.

## 4. Operational Summary (Concise)

*【47†L415-L424】 Reaper capital ships “blink” into systems unimpeded. Major fleets (Batarian, human, turian) that awaited them at known relay exits are either evaded or overwhelmed in one-sided fights. Turian Fifth Fleet is shattered at Arcturus Station【47†L415-L424】.  
* In rapid succession, the Reapers begin orbital bombardments: Earth’s communication satellites and military bases are annihilated【47†L428-L437】. Similar strikes occur on Palaven (turian homeworld) and other capitals, causing global blackouts and mass civilian casualties.  
* The Reapers herd populations into kill zones: ground assaults use destroyers to prepare cities for “harvesting” rather than indiscriminate destruction【47†L428-L437】. This indicates their methodical plan: minimize waste to maximize live harvest.  
* The galactic front collapses in weeks. Alliance and Hierarchy commanders attempt desperate counterstrikes (nuking incoming forces, kamikaze ship tactics), but lack massed power. Borders between species shatter; only hypermassive concentration can slow Reapers.

## 5. Immediate Outcomes

* Military result: The Reapers achieve overwhelming dominance. Key worlds (Earth, Palaven, Khar’shan) fall one after another【53†L817-L825】. Council Starblades fail to stop the fleet.  
* Political shifts: The Citadel Council effectively dissolves; elected politicians are dead or in hiding. A Council War Council is formed (led by military heroes) to direct the resistance. Many governments declare martial law.  
* Territorial changes: Milky Way’s populated worlds become occupied zones. Five-sixths of the galactic population is either enslaved (indoctrinated) or driven underground. A few frontier systems remain free but besieged.  
* Social upheaval: Mass panic spreads. Religious cults arise (some inspired by pro-Reaper eschatology). Interstellar communication is nearly severed; each planet adapts in isolation.

## 6. Long-Term Structural Consequences

* Institutional reforms: Total war mandates lead to previously unthinkable measures: mass-relay destruction is considered (and partially attempted), AI rights are suspended (dreadnoughts commanded to use geth help). The post-war galaxy (if there is one) will likely see a vastly different power structure – new membership on the Council (e.g. if volus/others survive) or even a replacement governance (Earth Council as a war-time organ).  
* Economic restructuring: The entire economy converts to “war footing”: factories repurpose for warship production (if possible), planets prioritize survival. Automated systems (like guardian satellites) are pressed into service wherever left intact. Post-invasion, even if some victory is possible, independent budgets shift to reconstruction.  
* Cultural trauma: This war surpasses all previous catastrophes. Every culture unites on a single existential fear. Memorials and art from this era will inevitably emphasize themes of sacrifice, unity, and rebirth. The psychological scars ensure that no future generation believes in invulnerability.  
* Power redistribution: The human Alliance and Turian Hierarchy likely fuse their navies; after the war, Earth may gain a permanent Council seat (it does in known canon). Other races (like Volus or Drell, who suffered heavy losses) may either lose Council status or demand large reforms.  
* New alliances or enmities: Species previously wary of each other (Hanar and Elcor, Quarians and Geth) may temporarily ally purely out of necessity. Meanwhile, historical grudges (e.g. Salarians vs. Krogan) may be paused or fall away if both agree on a mutual enemy. However, minor factions (like rogue mercenaries) may fight each other for dwindling resources.

## 7. Persistent Effects in Post-2157 Galaxy

* Ongoing tension patterns: Survivors (especially humans and turians) are forever vigilant. Military commands adopt “legacy of ’26” protocols – permanent high alert on all fronts. Any hint of massing alien fleets triggers immediate precautions (e.g. mass mobilizations and relay shutdowns).  
* Policy restrictions: After witnessing the destruction, the Council War Council likely bans any technology deemed “Reaper-like” (for example, any AI that organizes itself is heavily policed). Reliance on old heavy fleet designs is strengthened. Mass relay policies become even more stringent, ironically studying Reaper networks carefully but forbidding civilian tampering.  
* Social prejudice: Societies become less tolerant of outsiders or fringe groups. Anyone advocating “radical new physics” (in extreme conspiracy) might be censored.  
* Strategic caution behaviors: The mass annihilation mindset causes all governments to maintain a high percentage of resources in reserve forces. Open borders become a thing of the past; star lanes are scanned continuously. The very concept of a galaxy at peace is replaced with readiness for the next “Harvest”.  
* Risk thresholds: The line for preemptive action lowers. If scouts identify another existential threat (e.g. a mention of human-curated mass relays beyond known cluster), war cabinets no longer debate permission to act – they just respond. This hardened stance against unknown risks is a direct effect of having been nearly wiped out once already.
