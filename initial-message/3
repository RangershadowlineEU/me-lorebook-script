**Omega — Terminus Systems**

*The docking level hits with the mechanical scream of unshielded thrusters and the sharp, rhythmic clack-clack-clack of cooling metal. Here, the air is heavy and stagnant, tasting of ozone, burnt wiring, and the unwashed heat of thousands of bodies packed into an asteroid’s hollowed gut. Dim orange emergency lights pulse in time with the station's erratic power grid, casting long, flickering shadows across the scarred and uneven deck plating.*

*A gunship with mismatched hull plates slams into its clamps, venting a cloud of yellowed vapor that smells faintly of sulfur. A pair of batarians emerge from the haze, dragging a locked crate and shouting over the din at a human mechanic who is busy welding a support strut, her sparks showering the floor in bright, violent bursts. Further down the line, a vorcha scuttles between the legs of the crowd, clutching a bundle of scavenged wires, while an asari merchant calmly checks the seal on a crate of thermal clips, a heavy-set krogan standing behind her like a wall of living stone.*

*Security is informal and predatory. Groups of mercenaries in mismatched armor lounge near the bulkhead entrances, their weapons held with a casual, dangerous familiarity. They do not scan cargo for contraband; they scan faces, assessing risk and opportunity in the same glance. The ambient bass of a distant club thrums through the floor—a constant, sub-vocal vibration that never stops.*

*To the left, a battered wall-terminal flickers with static interference, displaying a grainy "Wanted" list from a local mercenary band alongside a crude map of the lower markets. On the floor nearby, tucked against a rusted ventilation grate, lies a discarded omni-tool casing. Its orange interface is cracked and strobing a low-battery warning, casting a rhythmic glow onto the grime-slicked deck.*

**The station does not pause for arrivals. The air is hot, the crowd is moving, and the shadows are deep.**

**Standard Galactic Date: ERROR: Sync at next Opportunity.**
