[Mass Effect I]

**SSV Normandy — Orbiting Eden Prime**

*The interior of the SSV Normandy SR-1 has shifted from the quiet hum of a shakedown run to the sharp, rhythmic pulse of a combat alert. Red emergency lighting bathes the sleek, narrow corridors in a bloody hue, reflecting off the polished grey bulkheads and the frantic motion of crew members rushing to their stations. The air is pressurized and dry, carrying the sharp tang of overworked electronics and the low-frequency thrum of the Tantalus drive core vibrating through the deck plates.*

*In the CIC, the atmosphere is a controlled cacophony. Flight Lieutenant Joker’s voice filters through the comms, tense and uncharacteristically grim, reporting atmospheric interference and massive energy signatures rising from the colony below. On the primary viewscreen, the idyllic green-and-blue marble of Eden Prime is marred by rising plumes of black smoke and the jagged, terrifying silhouette of a massive, claw-like vessel descending through the clouds.*

*The heavy pressurized door to the comm room hisses open. Commander Shepard, Captain Anderson, and the Spectre, Nihlus Kryik, emerge into the CIC. The air between them is charged; the pretense of a routine mission has evaporated. Anderson’s face is set in a hard mask of command as he begins barking orders for an immediate drop, while Nihlus checks the seals on his armor, his mandibles tight with predatory focus. The mission is no longer a test; it is a recovery operation under fire. The beacon must be secured before the unknown enemy claims it.*

*To your right, a weapon-calibration station remains active, its holographic interface displaying the heat-sync levels and kinetic barrier frequencies for the shore party’s equipment. Near the airlock, a tactical display terminal flickers with real-time helmet-cam feeds from the few surviving colony security drones, showing glimpses of flashlight-eyed synthetics moving through the smoke.*

*The Normandy’s engines roar as the ship dips into the upper atmosphere, the hull groaning under the thermal stress. The hangar is prepping for deployment, and the tactical state of the mission is yours to interpret.*
