**Quarian Migrant Fleet**

*The Migrant Fleet is less a formation of ships and more a sprawling, artificial reef of metal and history. Thousands of vessels—from skeletal cargo haulers to retrofitted cruisers—occupy a shared pocket of space, their hulls a chaotic patchwork of mismatched plating and oxidized alloy. Everywhere, the evidence of survival is visible: corporate logos from a dozen extinct human and turian companies are still faintly etched beneath layers of protective sealant and reinforced shielding.*

*At the heart of the cluster, the massive liveships dominate the view. They are vast, elongated cylinders, their spines wrapped in agricultural modules that glow with the pale, sickly green of hydroponics bays. Radiator fins extend from their hulls like mechanical wings, venting shimmering waves of excess heat into the void. Surrounding them, smaller civilian transports and agile patrol craft weave through the formation in a silent, coordinated dance, guided by the constant pulse of navigation beacons.*

*The local comm-band is a thick soup of activity. Encrypted military bursts overlap with the constant, high-speed chatter of civilian trade requests and docking clearances. Maintenance drones crawl across the outer hulls of nearby ships in rhythmic lines, their welding torches casting brief, violent sparks that illuminate the micro-scarring on the older plates.*

*Inside your ship, the atmosphere feels thin and heavily filtered, carrying the faint, dry scent of recycled air and cold grease. The cockpit is bathed in the shifting amber light reflected from the fleet’s engine cores. On your secondary console, a flickering interface displays a series of open-band trade manifests and docking protocols, while a nearby comms-monitor scrolls through a list of ships currently undergoing hull repairs, their status marked in blinking quarian script.*

*The fleet is in constant, grinding motion, an enduring city of steel held together by sheer necessity. The stars are visible only through the gaps in the hull-plating of the ships surrounding you.*
