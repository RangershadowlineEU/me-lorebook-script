**Mass Relay — Citadel System**

*Space here is illuminated by the harsh, unfiltered glare of a white star, turning ship hulls into sheets of polished silver and casting long, razor-sharp shadows across the geometry of the Mass Relay. The relay itself hangs in the void like a deliberate scar, its two massive curved arms framing a central core of swirling, blue-black energy. Periodic pulses of Cherenkov radiation ripple along its inner rings—restrained, ancient power waiting for a catalyst.*

*Your ship holds its position within the regulated traffic lanes, thrusters firing in short, silent bursts to counter the subtle gravitational tug of the nebula's core. The vibration is a faint, rhythmic thrum against the soles of your boots, a constant reminder of the drive core's steady heartbeat. Several kilometers away, a massive cruiser idles in a holding pattern, its heat-sinks glowing a dull, disciplined orange against the cobalt haze of the surrounding nebula. Farther off, a civilian transport executes a slow, silent rotation, its sensors likely sweeping the exclusion zone as it waits for transit clearance.*

*When a ship far across the sector finally hits the aperture, the relay responds with a sudden, violent intensification of light. For a fraction of a second, the energy arcs between the arms, collapsing inward before the vessel is simply gone, leaving only a lingering electromagnetic whisper that crackles across your ship's comm-band.*

*Inside the cockpit, the atmosphere is quiet, smelling of recycled air and warm electronics. The canopy glass is a mirror for the flickering interface of the navigation console. One holographic prompt blinks steadily in the periphery, requesting a confirmed transit vector for the relay, while another display scrolls through a series of passive long-range scans, picking up the fragmented pings of the ships sharing this patch of deep space.*

*The star burns without regard for schedules, and the relay remains vast and patient. Every direction is open; the flight path is yours to calibrate.*

**Standard Galactic Date: ERROR: Sync at next Opportunity.**
