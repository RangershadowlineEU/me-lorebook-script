[Mass Effect II]

**SSV Normandy — Orbiting Alchera**

*The quiet of the deep-space patrol is not broken by an alarm, but by a violent, structural groan that vibrates through every bulkhead simultaneously. One moment, the Normandy SR-1 is gliding through the silent shadow of the ice world Alchera; the next, a single lance of golden energy—monolithic and terrifyingly precise—slices through the center of the ship. The beam shears through the hull like a hot wire through kinetic barriers, bisecting the midsection and exposing the CIC directly to the freezing vacuum.*

*The atmosphere is gone in a scream of escaping pressure. Emergency shutters slam downward, but they are jagged and failing, struggling to seal against the melted slag of the deck plating. Orange sparks shower from the ceiling as gravity fails, sending debris and unmoored equipment drifting into the encroaching frost of deep space. The air that remains is a suffocating mix of ozone, burning insulation, and the metallic tang of blood.
Through the massive breach in the hull, the Collector ship looms—a jagged, insectoid mountain of dark stone and glowing orange light, indifferent to the wreckage it has created.*

*Commander Shepard is visible through the haze of the flickering emergency lights, fighting against the decompression to reach the cockpit where Joker is still stubbornly strapped into his seat, attempting to keep the dying ship level. The crew is a blur of motion and panicked shouting over the comm-channels—shouts that are being cut off one by one as systems fail. The SR-1 is not just damaged; she is breaking apart.*

*Near a support pillar, a localized damage-control terminal continues to flicker, its screen strobing with red "CRITICAL HULL BREACH" warnings while attempting to reroute power to the remaining escape pods. Floating just a few meters away in the zero-gravity environment is a pressurized emergency kit, its magnetic latch partially disengaged, drifting slowly toward the gaping hole in the ship's side.*

*The ship is dying, the enemy is waiting, and the vacuum is closing in. The next few seconds will define survival.*
