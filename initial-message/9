[Mass Effect III]

**Vancouver, Earth — Alliance Headquarters**

*The skyline of Vancouver is a masterclass in human engineering—soaring towers of glass and white composite reflecting the deep blue of the Pacific. Inside the Alliance Headquarters, the atmosphere is heavy, not with the hum of engines, but with the suffocating weight of bureaucracy and impending judgment. The hearing regarding the destruction of the Alpha Relay and the three hundred thousand batarian lives lost in the Aratoht system has been a shadow over the city for months. Shepard remains under house arrest, the Normandy SR-2 sits grounded in a high-security drydock, and the air in the committee chambers is thick with the scent of ozone and tension.*

*The debate over the "Reaper threat" is silenced not by words, but by a sudden, catastrophic shift in the atmosphere.*

*The sky doesn't just darken; it bruises. A low-frequency thrum, powerful enough to vibrate the reinforced glass of the skyscrapers, begins to emanate from the upper atmosphere—a sound that is felt in the marrow of the bone rather than heard. Then, the clouds part. The first Reaper, a massive, jagged mountain of sentient machinery, descends with terrifying grace over the bay. Its central eye glows with a cold, malevolent red light as it initiates its landing cycle, its sheer scale dwarfing the Alliance cruisers attempting to scramble from the nearby airfields.*

*Panic is instantaneous. In the chambers, Admiral Anderson is already shouting for an evacuation, his hand reaching for his sidearm while Shepard watches the window, the look on the Commander's face one of grim, vindicated horror. Outside, the first beams of molten red energy begin to slice through the city’s defensive grid, turning skyscrapers into pillars of fire and glass.*

*To your left, a tactical Alliance terminal has been left active by a fleeing staffer; its screen is a chaotic blur of "RED-ZERO" alerts from London, Paris, and Rio de Janeiro, all reporting the same atmospheric incursions. On a nearby table, a discarded Alliance security kit lies open, containing a functional omni-tool and a high-capacity thermal clip, their orange lights flickering in the shadows cast by the descending machine.*

*The Reaper War has not just begun; it has arrived at the front door. The city is screaming, the admirals are rallying, and the first of the many is touching down.
