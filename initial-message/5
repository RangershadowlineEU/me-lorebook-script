**Illium — Nos Astra**

*The Nos Astra spaceport is an exercise in corporate elegance, designed to mask the raw machinery of commerce with sweeping white composite and polished glass. The docking platforms are suspended thousands of feet above the planet's surface, hanging over a sea of clouds that glow with the soft, bruised violet of a permanent twilight. The air here is thin and meticulously filtered, carrying the sharp, synthetic scent of high-end perfumes mixed with the faint, biting ozone of skycar slipstreams.*

*Traffic is relentless but silent. Sleek, high-performance shuttles and corporate yachts glide into their berths with magnetic precision, their hulls reflecting the endless, shimmering stream of skycars that pulse through the city's vertical canyons. On the main concourse, the crowd is a study in calculated status: asari shipping magistrates in flowing silks move with practiced grace, flanked by krogan bodyguards wearing tailored civilian armor. Salarian brokers argue over flickering holographic trade manifests, their speech rapid and hushed, while human corporate executives tap impatiently at glowing omni-tools.*

*Everywhere, the architecture serves as a canvas for commerce. Massive, three-dimensional holographic advertisements shimmer in the open air, promoting biotics training, luxury penthouse suites in the Dantrius Towers, and discreet "indentured service" contracts with the planet’s major logistics firms. The ambient sound is a low, expensive hum—the collective noise of millions of credits changing hands in real-time.*

*Near the primary transit lift, a public terminal cycles through a series of high-end real estate listings and interstellar stock fluctuations. Its display is crisp, casting a steady blue light onto the pristine floor. Beside the terminal, perched on the edge of a curved stone planter, sits a discarded datapad. Its screen is partially obscured by a digital encryption prompt, but a notification for an "Unsecured Trade Inquiry" blinks steadily in the corner of the glass.
The city stretches upward and downward in a forest of neon and steel, indifferent to those who cannot afford the view. The skyscrapers catch the light of the setting sun, and the next transaction is yours to initiate.*
